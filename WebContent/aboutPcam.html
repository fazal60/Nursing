		<font size=4 color="white"><p>The PCAM has its origin in the Minnesota Complexity Assessment Method, which was developed to bring a broad range of aspects of health into patient assessments, including physical health, mental health, social support, social needs, health literacy and engagement with services. The MCAM was derived from INTERMED which integrated biopsychosocial aspects of the relationship between the patient and the healthcare system which, taken together, reflect case complexity, and was used in secondary care [2-5]. The purpose of MCAM was to provide a practical but systematic vocabulary and action-based assessment which could be applied to a primary care setting.  The MCAM has also been used to help improve interdisciplinary team work in educational settings [6]. </p></font>
		<br><font size=4 color="white"><p><b>Can I use PCAM?</b></p></font>
		<font size=4 color="white"><p>Yes.  PCAM is copyrighted, and the developer team are committed to it being freely available for use.  PCAM is best implemented with the support of training for clinicians, and consideration of how systems support the integration of the tool.We do ask you contact the team to inform and involve us where possible, as we strive to develop and support learning partnerships about how PCAM is used, improved and further our understanding of how it impacts patient outcomes.</p></font>
